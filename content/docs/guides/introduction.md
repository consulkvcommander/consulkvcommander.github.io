ConsulKVCommander is a one stop toolkit, deployed as a Kubernetes Operator, in one’s cluster to  take care of the many responsibilities of managing a Hashicorp ConsulKV datastore. 

This includes making sure that Hashicorp ConsulKV datastore for any downtimes or ensuring any exposure of  sensitive data or overly large payload is not ignored. Not only detecting but analyzing, reporting and  notifying (paging on PagerDuty) the users during the occurrence of such events is taken care of as  well whilst being backed by a thorough rule-based engine targeted towards minimizing pager fatigue.  

Moreover, this tool provides capabilities to migrate the data present in the Hashicorp ConsulKV  datastore to the customer’s cluster in the form of ConfigMaps potentially well-digestible by the apps  deployed in their cluster. All of these functionalities would be backed by the self-adaptive lifecycle of  numerous self-healing feedback loops ensuring the consistency wherever need be, despite the  occurrence of any drift.

Last but not least, ConsulKVCommander is built on top of self-configuring mechanisms as well to re-scale itself smartly during high loads.
