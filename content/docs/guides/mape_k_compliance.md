Being the self-adaptive system ConsulKVCommander is, it complies well with the MAPE-K Framework:

* **Monitoring**: Continuous observation of ConsulKV Store and Kubernetes environment. Moreover, real-time tracking of resource usage and sensitive data exposure.
* **Analysis**: Advanced algorithms assess data sensitivity and resource utilization backed by utility functions which evaluate risk and need for adaptive actions.
* **Planning**: Determines responses (self-healing or self-protecting) based on analysis followed by formulating resource adjustment strategies for system optimization (self-optimization).
* **Execution**: Implements planned self-protecting and self-healing actions like data segregation and nuking sensitive K-V pairs. Furthermore, it takes the self-optimizing action to adapt systemâ€™s configuration in response to identified needs.
* **Knowledge**: Maintains an etcd-backed knowledge base with historical data and operational patterns. Leverages knowledge to inform future decisions and enhance system efficiency and security.
